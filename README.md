We wanted to make an app that solved a problem. We came up with an idea for an app that helps caregiver groups get organised and share information, when taking care of the elderly.<br>  
### Users
- Carers: Family members, relatives or friends that need to get organised as a group caring for elderly people.
- The Elderly: As an ongoing project, we would have liked to add an interface for the elderly.

### In the app you can:
- Get organised as a team
- Create events in the form of meet ups or appointments
- Create todos with priority tags
- Write updates in a journal
